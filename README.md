### Aviator Game Guide: How to Play

The Aviator game is different from typical slot games, and understanding
its mechanics is key to maximizing your chances of winning.

#### The Basics:

-   **Objective**: The goal is to cash out before the plane flies away.
    The multiplier increases as the plane rises, but if it flies away
    before you cash out, you lose your bet.
-   **Betting**: You can place two simultaneous bets, giving you the
    opportunity to hedge your risks.

#### Tricks and Tips:

1.  **Start Small**: Begin with small bets to understand the game
    mechanics and the multiplier patterns.
2.  **Observe Patterns**: While the game is random, some players like to
    observe previous multipliers to guess when to cash out.
3.  **Use Auto-Cashout**: Set your auto-cashout at a lower multiplier to
    ensure you don't miss out on winnings.
